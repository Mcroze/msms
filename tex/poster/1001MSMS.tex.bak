\headerbox{Abstract}{name=abstract,column=0,row=0}{
We have implemented a coalescent simulation program for a structured population
with selection at a single diploid locus with high performance called {\it
msms}\cite{ewing2010}. This program can be used to study the patterns of molecular
evolution under a wide range of different senerios. One such senerio is the study of Arabidopsis thoughout
Europe. Arabidopsis recolonized Europe after galcial retreat at the end of the
last ice age. Detecting adaptive selection from the wide range of climates is
complicated by the recolonization patterns which can confound tests of selective
sweeps. By using {\it msms} we can study how current tests perform as well as
devlope new tests.

The ability to simulate all kinds of selective scenarios efficiently opens the possibility to 
estimate selection parameters via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). 
%{\it msmsABC} is  to be compatible with the ABC toolbox from
%the CMPG lab at the University of Bern.

The figures show sucsessfull estimation of the mutation parameter $\theta$ and
selection strength $\alpha$. However currently poor estimation of the position
of the selected locus and time of fixation. However better performance is
expected with iEHH type statistics.

\headerbox{Conclusion}
 {name=theend,below=abc,span=1,column=2}{
 
 {\it MSMS}\cite{ewing2010} is a powerful coalescent simulator with selection at
 a single locus. A wide range of applications are possible with the combination
 of flexibility and speed that {\it msms} provides.  A specific application is
 is an Arabadobis data set throughout Sweeden, where  seperating population
 structure and local adaptation are challeging problems to detecting selective
 sweeps. 
 }

\headerbox{Simulation Method}{name=sims,below=abstract,column=0}{

{\it MSMS}\cite{ewing2010} uses an infinite sites mutation model and locus
model.
\vspace{.1cm}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../locus.pdf}

Simulations are carried out in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A forward pass simulates selection with drift. The
  result is the frequency of the selected allele over time for each deme.
  \item The coalescent is then simulated in the pastward direction {\em
  conditional} on the frequency of the selected locus.
  \item Neutral mutations are added to the ancestral recombination graph.
\end{enumerate}
To sample the coalescent conditionally on frequency,  we assume discrete generations 
during the selected phase. Two lineages can only be nonrecombinant
descendants of a parent if they share the allele at the selected locus. Therefore the
effective population size of the selected allele is scaled by the frequency.
All other events are affected similarly.

The figure shows the computing speed of {\it msms} without selection compared to
{\sc ms} on a standard desktop PC:  AMD64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+, using Sun
Java 1.6u18 64bit and gcc 4.2.3.
{\it msms} is faster than {\sc ms} with intermediate to high
recombination. The command line used was:

{\tt ms 50 1000 -t 100 -r $\rho$ 10000}

\section*{The Data}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Arabidopsis genomes from Sweeden.
  \item GPS positions.
  \item Phenotypes.
  \item Recoliniziation after the galical retreat is probably from two
  different founding populations. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\section*{Questions}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Has Selective sweeps occured? If so are they localy adaptive sweeps?
  \item Can we seperate dispersive effects from local adaptation?
  \item When demeography is taken into account, what happens to the power tests?
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\section*{Approach}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We can model many deme models quicky with {\it msms}.
  \item Can study behavour of ideal models, while comparing with real data. 
  \item Devlope tests that condtion on demography or are insensitive to it. 
\end{itemize}
